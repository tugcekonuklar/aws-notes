## S3 101

* S3 stands for simple storage service
* it provides the secure, durable and highly scalable object storage.
* it's object storage and it's really for files, images, webpages and that kind of thing.
* it's also super scalable and allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web at a very
  low cost.
* S3 is **object based** storage so it manages it data as objects rather than in file systems like an operating system or in
  data blocks.
* you can upload any type of file that you can think of to S3.
    * For example, photos, videos, code, documents and text files.
* However, it cannot be used to run an operating system or a database.
* S3 you get unlimited storage.
    * So the total volume of data and the number of objects that you can store is unlimited.
* S3 objects can be up to 5 TB terabytes in size
    * they can range in size from a minimum of 0byte->5TB.
* within S3 the files are stored in **buckets**.
    * And a bucket is similar to a folder and it's really just a container and it's the name that AWS uses for the
      location where you are storing your files.
* S3 actually has a universal namespace.
    * And that means that all AWS accounts share the same S3 namespace and each S3 bucket name must be globally unique.
    * similar to a DNS address or an internet address which must also be globally unique.
* S3 URL:
    * https://**bucket-name**.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/**key-name**
    * https://**tugcecoloudguru**.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/**cat.jpeg**
    * keyname is the name of the object
* when you upload a file into an S3 bucket you are going to receive an HTTP 200 code if the upload was successful.
    * you'll only see this code if you're uploading using the API or the command line interface
* S3 is a key value store
    * the key which is simply the name
      of the object i.e cat.jpg.
    * the value, and this is really the data itself which is made up of a sequence of bytes which makes up the object.
    * a version ID which is important when we come to store multiple versions of the same object.
    * metadata and if you haven't heard that term before metadata just really means data about data
        * For example, content type, last modified or you could even add the name of the team that owns the file or the
          project that the file is related to.

* s3 is a safe place to store your data files and the data is spread across multiple devices and multiple facilities to
  ensure availability and durability.
    * And what that means is that Amazon could lose one of their devices or facilities and the S3 service will still be
      available.
* S3 is designed to be both highly available and highly durable.
    * S3 is built for between 99.95 and 99.99% service availability depending on the S3 tier that you select to store
      your data.
* it is also designed for 11 nines (99,9999999999) durability for data stored in S3.
    * we say durability that is all about your data being stored safely and not getting lost or corrupted
* S3 offers tiered storage.
    * So it offers a range of storage courses or tiers designed for different use cases depending on the type of data
      that you might be storing and your own business requirements.
* S3 has lifecycle management which allows you to set rules and define rules to automatically transition objects to a
  cheaper storage tier or even delete objects which are no longer required after a set period of time.
* versioning.
    * So with versioning all versions of an object are stored and can be retrieved including deleted objects.
    * So that means we can keep multiple historical versions of the same file allowing you to roll back to a previous
      version if you accidentally changed or deleted your file.
* Security:
    * S3 can enable server-side encryption:
        * you can set up default encryption on a bucket which will encrypt all new objects when they are stored in the
          bucket.
    * got access control lists:
        * which allow you to define which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access they're
          granted as well.
        * And you can attach S3 access control lists to individual objects within a bucket.
        * So that really gives you fine grained access control.
    * bucket policies
        * S3 bucket policies specify which actions are allowed or denied.
        * For example, you can use a bucket policy to allow a user named Alice to put but not delete objects within a
          bucket that you own.
